   = help: the following implementations were found:
             <u32 as std::clone::Clone>
   = note: `std::clone::Clone` is implemented for `&u32`, but not for `&mut u32`
   = note: required by `std::clone::Clone::clone`
   = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
