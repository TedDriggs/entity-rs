     = help: the following implementations were found:
               <Value as From<&'a str>>
               <Value as From<BTreeMap<String, T>>>
               <Value as From<BTreeSet<T>>>
               <Value as From<BinaryHeap<T>>>
             and 24 others
     = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<Value>` for `CustomField`
     = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
